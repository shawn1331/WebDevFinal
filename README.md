Intro. to Web Development Final Project

# 🎮 Connect 4 Final Project Proposal

## Overview
For my final project, I will build an interactive **Connect 4 web game** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the front-end and a **C# Minimal API** for the back-end.  
Players will be able to create or join game lobbies, drag and drop their pieces to play, and compete either locally or online through the hosted API.

This project interests me because it combines **game logic**, **UI design**, and **API development** — all key skills we’ve learned in Intro to Web Development. I also enjoy making games that feel polished and user-friendly, and Connect 4 is a great challenge to showcase JavaScript modules, DOM manipulation, drag-and-drop, and async API calls.

## Project Features
- Multi-page website with shared header, nav, and footer
- Lobby page with filters to search/join games
- Drag-and-drop gameplay board
- Persistent data stored through a custom C# backend API
- External API integration (RandomUser.me for player avatars)
- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Hosted API on the cloud (Render or Railway)

---

## Technical Requirements Checklist
✅ **HTML:** forms, inputs, select, reset, submit, img, links, lists, figure, sections, asides, nav  
✅ **CSS:** selectors, transitions, hover, nth-child, flex/grid layout, variables, accessible color contrast  
✅ **JavaScript:** modules, map/filter, DOM manipulation, event listeners, async/await, querystrings, localStorage  
✅ **Functional:** multi-page site, filter bar, external API call, drag-and-drop, shared layout  
✅ **Server:** custom C# backend API hosted online

## Project Goals
- Meet **all technical, functional, and server requirements** in the final-project rubric.  
- Design a responsive and accessible UI that works on desktop and mobile.  
- Organize JavaScript code into **UI**, **Domain**, and **Service** modules.  
- Host my C# API online so that other players can connect to games.
